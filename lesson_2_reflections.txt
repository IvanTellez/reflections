What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A file .git is created, which is invisible to the user, but you can see it using the command ls -a.
And you need this to start commiting
Init is to create a new repository.
Add is to add a file to the staging area.
Staging area, is where files go before being commited, you can have as many files you want.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
From the working directory is different in the sense that it is a temporary working area.
From the repository it doent store commits, but pre-commits if you may say.
And the value it has, is that it gives you the opportunity to stage various file and commit them at once, in one commit.

git diff ad1 ad2, is for comparing to files in the repository.
git diff with no arguments, is for comparing to files in the working directory and in the staging directory
git diff --staged, is to compare files in the staging area and the repository, before, comitting in the staging area.
git reset --hard, cancels all the changes you've made

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By comparing to the updated version of the file that hasnt been comitted yet.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you want to make experimental changes to the file. Changes that you dont want to belong to the main file in the master branch. Branches would help in the sense that you are making an alternate branch from the master branch, and it wont have any effect on the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Its help me because it visual, visually i can understand better the behave fo the different branches.
